emb9p - embedded 9p server

OVERVIEW

The objective of this project is to provided and embedded (or embeddable)
9p file server without dependency on an underlying OS. Specifically,
without a dependency on the concept of file desciptors and read()/write()
syscalls. The messages might just be getting crammed in through a UART.

This could be useful for running a PoC 9p server on simulated RTL, eg. 
simming RISC-V SoCs with a 9p server exposing various registers over a
serial line. Or for porting Inferno to a potato. Up to you.

STATUS

Currently, this consists of useful <fcall.h> functions to handle parsing
of 9p messages ripped straight from Plan9 source code
